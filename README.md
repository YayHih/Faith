# Faith
Imagine a scenario where you have just become homeless, you have just gotten into a situation where you are scared, confused, and desperately looking for someone's help. That's where Faith comes in. With Faith, one is able to check availabilities at local shelters, access the up-to-date information in soup kitchens, as well as signing up for job coaching all through Faith.
